# Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies
Blockchain allows multiple parties to store and verify information without the need for a central authority.  It works creating a chain of blocks, each containing a set of data, and using cryptography for the security and integrity of the information.  This technology can disrup industries by making the trasnfer of assets, data and money more efficient and transparent.

Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual tokens that use cryptography to secure and verify transactions on a blockchain network.
